# Dashboard-E-Commerce-Analysis

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data with a particular emphasis on answering key business questions. The dashboard, built using Streamlit, allows for interactive exploration of sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

In this project, the analysis specifically addresses the following business questions:

1. Which product (product_id) has the highest sales volume?
2. Which state has the highest number of purchases?
